# Visualizing-Google-Playstore-data
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, D3.js

The main aim of this project is to help the users download the applications of their chosen category based on the user rating. 
A visualization that shows the top applications based on the category be it paid or free application. 
It helps the user download the best application in that category.

The Google playstore data is represented visually in the form of Sunburst chart, Hierarchical bar charts and bar charts.

A sunburst graph with interactivity that displays the application names based on category, price, rating. 
When a user hovers on the rating of their choice, top 10 apps of that specified category will be displayed. 
This helps the users to choose an application of their choice.

An interactive bar chart that displays the number of user ratings based on the genre within the games category. 
This helps the user to know which genre of games received the highest ratings.

An interactive Hierarchical Bar Chart helps to visualize the data hierarchically. 
The data used for this chart is the same as the Sunburst chart. 
The data is visualized in the form of bars extending towards the horizontal axis and base on the vertical axis. 
“App categories” are displayed along the vertical axis and the “Total number of apps” are displayed along the horizontal axis. 
When clicked on a bar, the bar is divided into its sub- category.
